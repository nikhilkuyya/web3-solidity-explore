## Counter 

- Update the State by Increment,Decrement Action
- Events to Listen to the state update or transaction performed.

### Learning

- sendTransaction 
  - we need signer along with provider.
- Events 
  - Events are logged into the some store which can emited to frontend integration, like websockets.
- ABI: interface which we can provider for the contract connection from the JSON output.
- Observation: Working with local deployement doesn't scale with larger nonce.
- You cannot console.log with the int are parameter; // need to look for the contract to understading the methods.:


### Investigating

- Why is base value is int with 32 bit. example: string is converted to int while storing.
- Deploying to test network
- How event works in depth.
